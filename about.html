            classes (Many of these classes had programming projects as well as
            assesments and other materials to show mastery of concepts): Object
            Oriented Programming I & II, Intro to computer Systems, Discrete

          <h3><strong>Internship/Work Experience</strong></h3>

          <p>
            For over 2.5 years, I interned at the National Heart ,
            Lung, Blood Institute (NHLBI) from July 2018 - March 2021. My tasks included developing SQL
            queries, and working on front end development using tools and technologies such as 
            JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS. I have also gotten exposure to Microsoft Dynamics 365 
            where I customized forms using JavaScript and established relationships between tables/entities. This was done through data modeling, specfically, by using ER diagrams
